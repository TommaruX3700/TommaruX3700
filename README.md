I believe that learning is a continuous process (even at work), and my whole focus is into improving my own skills.
I like to learn, develop and study by working on my own projects: I'm always open for any kind of collaboration and strongly belive into open-source softwares.

One day, I'd love to to work in game industry as a developer.
Feel free to contact me if you want to work together.
