Hi!
                                             
I'm a student who wants to became a skilled Software Developer.

Currently I am working on:
  > C++;
  > 
  > C#/VB.Net;

but I also plan to add to my stack:
  > Python;
  > 
  > Rust;
  > 
  > Java;

I like both Windows and Linux and really interested on all cybersecurity topics.

All your suggestions and tip&tricks are well accepted!

See ya!
