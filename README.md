Welcome to my Github profile!

I am a student who is passionate about software and game development.

Currently, I am working as a VB.net developer in the tech industry.
My favorite programming language is C++, and I love solving complex problems through programming.

My stack: C, C++, C#, Python and VB.NET

I aspire to work in the game development industry. I am actively learning and exploring OpenGL, Unity, Unreal Engine, and QT, which will help me achieve my dream job.

I am always open to collaborating on open-source projects. I am also eager to learn new technologies and collaborate with other developers on exciting projects. I believe that learning is a continuous process, and I work diligently to improve my skills.
