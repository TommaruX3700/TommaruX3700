Hi!
                                             
I'm a student who wants to became a skilled Software Developer specialized in application engineering & game development.

Currently I am working on:
  > C++;
  > 
  > C#/VB.Net;

but I also plan to add to my stack:
  > Python;
  > 
  > Rust;

I like both Windows and Linux and really interested on all cybersecurity topics.

All your suggestions and tip&tricks are well accepted!
I am also open up to all kinda of OpenSource projects, as a way to learn and build my skill up.

See ya!
